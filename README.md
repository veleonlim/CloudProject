# Cloud Project
 
"Kampung" is a web application that addresses the unique needs of Housing & Development Board (HDB) communities by serving as a digital community bulletin board for the residents. This innovative platform empowers administrators to seamlessly share vital announcements, from neighborhood alerts to information about upcoming community center events. Moreover, it offers residents the ability to create, explore, and register for engaging local events, fostering community engagement and promoting neighborhood-specific services.
